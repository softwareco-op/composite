Understanding DAG notification

DAG notification is the process of notifying parent and child nodes that a new node has been added to the dag.  This process is
necessary because nodes may arrive out of order, and when they do, they need to be notified so they can complete their transient
installation operations, such as attaching themselves to a parent nodes dom object.

It would be nice if I could depend on the nodes to always exist.
It would be nice if I could say that you can't depend on parent or child nodes to install, but this is impossible for dom objects.  
Unless it is not. What if the dom object also had the event to bind to and send along to children? Then their wouldn't need to be an installation step!
Div rendering depends on an onrender event, but what if it attached onrender to a pipeline, then it wouldn't need attachment either.

HtmlNode then has the problem of having multiple events occuring on the dom element and object, but only one set of child nodes.  So child nodes are
passed events that are not meant for them.  child nodes could have keys they accept, like neuron receptor sites.  So some children have render keys, others have onmouseup, etc...

when a child is added to the dag, it needs to notify the parent to rerender.  This could be a call from the child to the parent to render, or an update call.  The update call
is more general.

It would be expedient to allow the child to bind functions to the parent and get rid of the need for special child keys.
