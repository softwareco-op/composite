Objects should have a url, which is easily possible.  The url can be http://localhost/object/some-object-id
Objects should have an ip, which is actually many IPs because there may be many copies of the object across differnt systems.  But should they be abstracted to a single ip address?  
The system should never stop.  It is critical the design allows extension without being taken down and restarted.
Just play it grand.  To move with the future, always play your systems more grand than they seem to be right now.  -Alan Kay paraphrasing E Power Biggs
