understanding function attachment

Functions nodes such as Actions need to attach to dom objects, in order to take effect.
Function nodes such as pipeline functions need to attache to each other, in order to act as a pipe
There is the node relationship and the runtime relationship.
The node relationship is typically parent/child.  The child attaches to the parent's runtime object or the dom object under the runtime object.
Since the attachment point is variable, the child node needs to describe where to attach its functionality
Typical locations are node.object.el.onmouseup, node.object.el.click, node.object.add
The attachment point has been described differently depending on if the attachment point is the el dom element or the node object.
This should be simplified.  Instead describe that attachment point as a path e.g. 'node.object.el.onmouseup', 'node.object.add'
