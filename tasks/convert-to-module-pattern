Convert the current requirejs setup to module if the module pattern is compatible with mocha on node.js and the browser.  The structuring looks very promising, with the ability to pass in modules, extend or augment modules, load asynchronously via LABjs, and submodules

understanding composite module pattern

1. Each module is in its own separate file
2. Each module exports itself into a global object, typically the same object, for a project, namely composite in this case
3. The module can export into a sub object on the composite object
4. Modules can augment each other by taking the global object as a parameter and decorating it with more functions
5. Modules can be loosely augmented by passing in a parameter the global object || {}.
